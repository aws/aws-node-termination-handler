    "aboutText": "# Helm Chart for Node Termination Handler V2\n\n AWS NTHV2 gracefully handles EC2 instance shutdown within Kubernetes.\n\n The second major version of NTH aims to refine the Queue Processor Mode. Only a single pod is deployed and configuration is done using a new custom resource called Terminators. A Terminator contains much of the configuration about where NTH should fetch events, what actions to take for a given event type, filter nodes to act upon, and webhook notifications. Multiple Terminators may be deployed, modified, or removed without needing to redeploy NTH itself.\n\n This repository contains helm-charts for Node Termination Handler.\n\nWe can view more information on this project on branch v2, see the project repo at [AWS Node Termination Handler](https://github.com/aws/aws-node-termination-handler)",
    "usageText": "# We can install AWS NTHV2 using the helm chart from this repository.\n\nWe need to authenticate our helm client to ECR registry and install NTH chart using helm chart URI, detailed information on how to install helm chart can be found here [HelmChart ReadMe](https://github.com/aws/aws-node-termination-handler/tree/v2/charts/aws-node-termination-handler-2)"
